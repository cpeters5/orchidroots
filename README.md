A curated list of living things. 
Maintained by Chariya Punyanitya



## Project Overview:
This project is a growing database that catalogs nomenclature for 
living organisms and identifies their relationships, 
including hybrid parentage, ancestry, and taxonomic groupings. 
The platform provides tools for users to visually explore species and hybrid 
data and images to aid in identification and comparison among similar or related names.

## Mission: 
To catalog and visualize the intricate relationships and variations 
among living organisms, providing a comprehensive, accessible resource 
for understanding biodiversity and facilitating species identification 
through curated nomenclature and imagery.

## Features
* Species Nomenclature: Collects and organizes species names. A consolidated from authoritative sources
* Hybrid Parentage & Ancestry: Links species by hybrid, ancestor, and 
descendant relationships.
* Taxonomy Grouping: Provides infrageneric and infraspecific groupings.
* Image Comparison: Displays species images to aid in comparison and identification.
* Search and Filter Tools: Enables users to search and filter species, hybrids and taxonomy information.

## Usage
* Explore species relationships: Browse species data and images.
* Search and identify species: Use search functionality to find species by name, parentage, 
or groupings.
