## Project Overview:
This project is a growing database that catalogs nomenclature for 
living organisms and identifies their relationships, 
including hybrid parentage, ancestry, and taxonomic groupings. 
The platform provides tools for users to visually explore species and hybrid 
data and images to aid in identification and comparison among similar or related names.



## Mission: 
To catalog and visualize the intricate relationships and variations 
among living organisms, providing a comprehensive, accessible resource 
for understanding biodiversity and facilitating species identification 
through curated nomenclature and imagery.



## Features
